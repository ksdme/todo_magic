Goal
- Build a todo!() macro that is magical.
- Macros
- Build Scripts
- Demo



What do you need to do this?
- Intent
- Context
- Injection



Constraints
- Needs to run before the compilation phase



Macros
- Declarative Macros
- Procedural Macros



Build Script
- build.rs
- Compiled and run before src
- Has access to build dependencies



Declaraitve macros
- include!



Some stumbling blocks,
- Previous rust did not allow for concat to concat macro u64
- Declarative macros do not have access to outer context
- proc_macros need their own crates
- include! does compile checks
- Debugging build_scripts are hard



Where do we go from here?
- Build this into the compiler
- Profit
